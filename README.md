Experimental programme used to support several RB research projects between 2015 -  2017. 
Findings from the final RB project have been peer-reviewed and published.

Programme Scaffold was designed and initially created via Psychopy experiment builder (Pierce, 2007, 2008)

Modified code of specific stimuli below to fine tune experimental display parameters 

and restructure sequence flow based on literature recommendations and best practices


Tested and verified effect of forward and backwards visual masking of similar visual spatial frequency 

Tested and verified presence of RB effect with repetition as experimental baseline

RSVP frame rate was iteratively calibrated with a sample of participants prior to testing


EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT

Participants were individually tested in a room under normal lighting conditions
Stimuli were displayed on a Trinitron G520 CRT monitor (Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), 
Spatial resolution = 1024 × 768;
Refresh rate = 85 Hz

STIMULI SPECIFICATION:

All pictures and masks were presented centrally on screen, 
Max stimuli height and width at visual angle of 7.4 degrees subtended at the eye
Viewing distance = 50 cm, without chin rest

All words and masks were presented centrally on screen in Arial, 
word height at approximately 2.0 degrees of visual angle, 50cm viewing distance

GENERAL TRIAL SEQUENCE

Blank screen for 585 ms (50 frames) 

Forward mask 1170 ms (100 frames). 

Four test stimuli 106 ms (9 frames) apiece. 

Backward mask 1170 ms (100 frames). 

PRACTICE TRIALS
Fifteen practice trials were presented at the beginning of the testing session. 
The first five trials were conducted at 471 ms (40 frames) apiece, 
next five at approximately 129 ms (11 frames) apiece  
last five at approximately 106 (9 frames) apiece. 
In all practice trials, duration of forward and backward masks was kept at 1170 (100 frames) each
